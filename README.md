# Mathstronauts-Nexus

This repository contains projects developed during the **Mathstronauts Nexus** course, which I took in Grade 10. The course focused on learning Python and creating an independent project.

## Assignments
- Geometric Area Python Application: A program designed to calculate the areas of different geometric shapes.

- Unified Geometric Area Python Application: A unified version of the Geometric Area Application that integrates multiple shape calculations in one program.
  
- Fibonacci Sequence Python Assignment: Implements the Fibonacci sequence using Python, demonstrating recursion and iteration.
  
- Population Growth Class Python Assignment: A Python class that models population growth over time, applying basic principles of object-oriented programming.
  
- Rolling Dice Enhanced Python Assignment: Simulates rolling dice with additional features, such as tracking and analyzing the results.

## Independent Java GUI Project
Button Click Game (Java): A GUI-based game created using Java Swing. The application features three clickable buttons (A, B, C) that change the background color and display a message on the screen based on the button clicked. The project demonstrates proficiency in Java Swing, event handling, and GUI design.


## Requirements
- Python 3+ for the Python projects
- Java 8+ for the Java project

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mandal/Mathstronauts-Nexus.git
   ```
2.	No additional dependencies are required for Python projects.
3.	For the Java project, make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

## Usage
Run each Python script to see the individual applications in action:
```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

For the Java project, compile and run the Main.java file:
```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```
